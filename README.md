## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Git!
This is where I keep soem of my little project demonstrates how to process and analyze data using Python. It includes techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), cross-validation, and data visualization to extract meaningful insights from raw datasets.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing of data (normalization, filtering)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Model validation with k-fold cross-validation
- Visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn
- Reproducible pipeline using Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with earning experience to kickstart Data Science career
